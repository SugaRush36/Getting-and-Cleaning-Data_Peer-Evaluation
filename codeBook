Start with files:
'README.txt'
'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector. (see attached txt file)
'features.txt': List of all features.
'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units, 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

Load them into R using read.table()

Merge train files together: mrg_train
Merge test files together:  mrg_test
Merge into one: finalTable

Set column names

Extract mean and standard deviation

Assign names to the activities using activity_Lables

Create a second tidy data set: tidyDataSetFinal
and write it into a text file: tidyDataSetFinal.txt
