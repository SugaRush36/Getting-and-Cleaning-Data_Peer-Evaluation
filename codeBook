Start with files: subject_test.txt, x_test.txt, y_test.txt
                    subject_train.txt, x_train.txt, y_train.txt
                    features.txt, activity_labels.txt

Load them into R using read.table()

Merge train files together: mrg_train
Merge test files together:  mrg_test
Merge into one: finalTable

Set column names

Extract mean and standard deviation

Assign names to the activities using activity_Lables

Create a second tidy data set: tidyDataSetFinal
and write it into a text file: tidyDataSetFinal.txt
